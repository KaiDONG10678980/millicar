# Millicar - An ns-3 Module for MmWave NR V2X Networks #

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") module for the simulation
of Vehicle-to-Vehicle networks operating at mmWaves. A description of this module can be found on [TBD].

This module currently includes features such as:
- support to the latest 3GPP channel model for V2X networks, for frequency spectrum above 6 GHz;
- custom PHY and MAC classes, supporting the NR frame structure specified by 3GPP;
- full-stack operations including those from RLC and PDCP layers, thanks to the integration with the LTE module of ns-3;
- helpers and examples to guide users that want to interacts with the module.
